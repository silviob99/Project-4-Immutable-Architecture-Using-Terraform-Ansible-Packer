# Project-4-Immutable Infrastructure using Terraform, Ansible, Packer

Immutable infrastructure is an architectural approach in software engineering and system administration where infrastructure components, such as servers and networking configurations, are never modified after deployment. Instead of making changes to existing infrastructure, any updates or modifications are implemented by deploying new instances or resources.

"Project 4 implements immutable infrastructure with Terraform, Ansible, and Packer. It automates provisioning, configuration, and deployment, ensuring consistency, reliability, and simplified maintenance."

### Project Overview
Project-4: Immutable Infrastructure Implementation with Terraform, Ansible, and Packer is a tutorial-based project aimed at guiding users through the creation of an immutable infrastructure environment. In this project, users will learn how to leverage Terraform for infrastructure provisioning, Packer for creating immutable machine images, and Ansible for server configuration management.

The primary objective of this project is to provide a comprehensive understanding of immutable infrastructure principles and practices. By following the step-by-step instructions outlined in this tutorial, users will gain practical experience in building a resilient, scalable, and easily maintainable infrastructure setup that promotes consistency and reliability.

### Prerequsites

- Basic Understanding of Infrastructure Concepts: It's helpful to have a foundational understanding of infrastructure components such as servers, networking, and cloud services.

- Familiarity with Linux: Since you'll be working with Linux-based systems, having basic command-line skills and familiarity with Linux environments will be beneficial.

- Knowledge of DevOps Principles: Understanding DevOps principles and practices, such as infrastructure as code (IaC) and automation, will be important for implementing immutable infrastructure effectively.

- Experience with Terraform, Ansible, and Packer: While not strictly necessary, having some prior experience with Terraform, Ansible, and Packer will make it easier to follow along with the project. If you're new to these tools, be prepared to spend some time learning their basics as you progress through the project.

- Access to Cloud Provider or Virtualization Environment: You'll need access to a cloud provider like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform, or a virtualization environment like VirtualBox or VMware to deploy and test your infrastructure.

- Development Environment: Set up a development environment on your local machine where you can install and run the necessary tools like Terraform, Ansible, and Packer.

- Internet Connection: Ensure you have a stable internet connection to download any necessary software packages and documentation as you work through the project.

### Installation
To set up immutable infrastructure using Terraform, Ansible, and Packer for Project 4, follow these steps:


### Steps

#### Step 0: Preparing Prerequisites

Steps
Step 0: Preparing Prerequisites

Create an AWS account if you don't have one.
Ensure you have Terraform, Ansible, and Packer installed on your local machine.
Steps
Step 0: Preparing Prerequisites
Create an AWS account if you don't have one.
Launch an EC2 instance of the t2.nano family with Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS (HVM) image.
Step 1: Installing Nginx Web Server
Install Git Bash.
Launch Git Bash and run the following command to connect to your EC2 instance: ssh -i <Your-private-key.pem> ubuntu@<EC2-Public-IP-address>.
Install Nginx using the apt package manager.
Verify that Nginx is running by checking its status.
Step 2: Installing MySQL
Install MySQL using the apt package manager.
Run the MySQL security script to secure your MySQL installation.
Test if you can log in to the MySQL console.
Step 3: Installing PHP
Install PHP using the apt package manager.
Verify the PHP installation.
Step 4: Configuring Nginx to Use PHP Processor
Configure Nginx to use PHP-FPM to process PHP files.
Step 5: Testing PHP with Nginx
Create a test PHP file and verify that it's being served correctly by Nginx.
Step 6: Retrieving Data from MySQL Database with PHP
Connect to the MySQL database using PHP and retrieve data.
Usage
Once the LEMP stack is set up, you can use it to host and run web applications. To test if your installation is successful, you can access your website using the public IP address of your EC2 instance.
