# Project-4-Immutable Infrastructure using Terraform, Ansible, Packer

Immutable infrastructure is an architectural approach in software engineering and system administration where infrastructure components, such as servers and networking configurations, are never modified after deployment. Instead of making changes to existing infrastructure, any updates or modifications are implemented by deploying new instances or resources.

"Project 4 implements immutable infrastructure with Terraform, Ansible, and Packer. It automates provisioning, configuration, and deployment, ensuring consistency, reliability, and simplified maintenance."

### Project Overview
Project-4: Immutable Infrastructure Implementation with Terraform, Ansible, and Packer is a tutorial-based project aimed at guiding users through the creation of an immutable infrastructure environment. In this project, users will learn how to leverage Terraform for infrastructure provisioning, Packer for creating immutable machine images, and Ansible for server configuration management.

The primary objective of this project is to provide a comprehensive understanding of immutable infrastructure principles and practices. By following the step-by-step instructions outlined in this tutorial, users will gain practical experience in building a resilient, scalable, and easily maintainable infrastructure setup that promotes consistency and reliability.

### Prerequsites:

- Basic Understanding of Infrastructure Concepts: It's helpful to have a foundational understanding of infrastructure components such as servers, networking, and cloud services.

- Familiarity with Linux: Since you'll be working with Linux-based systems, having basic command-line skills and familiarity with Linux environments will be beneficial.

- Knowledge of DevOps Principles: Understanding DevOps principles and practices, such as infrastructure as code (IaC) and automation, will be important for implementing immutable infrastructure effectively.

- Experience with Terraform, Ansible, and Packer: While not strictly necessary, having some prior experience with Terraform, Ansible, and Packer will make it easier to follow along with the project. If you're new to these tools, be prepared to spend some time learning their basics as you progress through the project.

- Access to Cloud Provider or Virtualization Environment: You'll need access to a cloud provider like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform, or a virtualization environment like VirtualBox or VMware to deploy and test your infrastructure.

- Development Environment: Set up a development environment on your local machine where you can install and run the necessary tools like Terraform, Ansible, and Packer.

- Internet Connection: Ensure you have a stable internet connection to download any necessary software packages and documentation as you work through the project.

### Installation
To set up immutable infrastructure using Terraform, Ansible, and Packer for this project, follow these steps:


### Steps

#### Step 0: Preparing Prerequisites

- AWS Account
- Linux/Unix environment
- IDE (Visual Studio)
- Install Terraform on your machine
- Create folder three

#### Step 1: Setting up the folder tree

Step 1 for Project 4 involves setting up the folder structure as follows:

- Create a root folder named "Terraform project" with two subfolders: "Deployment" and "Module."
- Within the "Module" folder, create subfolders for different environments: "dev," "test," and "prod."
- Within each environment subfolder, create three additional subfolders: "Database," "Load Balancer," and "VPC."
- Open your integrated development environment (IDE) and navigate to the folder structure.
- Select the "VPC" folder and create a new file named "main.tf" and another file named "variables.tf," both with the ".tf" extension.
- Proceed to the next step once these files are created.
This step-by-step guide ensures an organized folder structure for your Terraform project, facilitating environment-specific configurations using modules.

#### Step 2: Setting up the folder tree
