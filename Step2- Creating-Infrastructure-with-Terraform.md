### Step 2: Creating Infrastructure with Terrafom

In this step, we'll use Terraform to create the necessary infrastructure components, including VPC, subnets, route tables, route table rules, and associations.
If you're using Visual Studio Code as your preferred text editor, you can follow these steps to open and edit the "main.tf" file:

1. Launch Visual Studio Code.
 
2. Navigate to the directory where your "main.tf" file is located. You can do this by clicking on "File" in the top menu, then selecting "Open Folder" and choosing the folder containing your Terraform project.

3. Once inside the folder, locate the "main.tf" file.

4. Right-click on the "main.tf" file and select "Open with Code" from the context menu. This will open the file in Visual Studio Code.

5. You can now edit the "main.tf" file as needed using the features and capabilities of Visual Studio Code.

6. After making your changes, save the file by pressing Ctrl + S (or Cmd + S on macOS) or by selecting "Save" from the "File" menu.

It will look like this picture below:

7. In the next step, we'll begin creating our infrastructure using Terraform. To get started, we'll visit the Terraform provider documentation for AWS, available at:
